    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony (Alabaster, Charcoal, Soft Blue, Muted Lilac) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A three-part, non-linear interactive application. Part 1 is a high-level introduction. Part 2 is the main Exploration Hub, a dashboard with two interactive grids (Mental Models, Strategic Frameworks). Clicking a card dynamically loads its content into a central view, allowing for user-driven, non-linear exploration. Part 3 covers implementation and risks in an accordion format. This structure was chosen to break down a dense, text-heavy report into digestible, interactive chunks, empowering the user to explore concepts based on their interest rather than following the report's linear flow, which enhances usability and engagement. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The application visualizes conceptual information through structure and interaction. The main navigation is a grid of interactive cards (HTML/Tailwind), each representing a concept. Goal: Organize & Navigate. Interaction: onClick to reveal details. Justification: Intuitive and space-efficient. The revealed content uses a side-by-side layout (HTML/Tailwind) to compare traditional vs. AI-enhanced approaches. Goal: Compare. Justification: Clearly shows the value-add of AI. Key takeaways are presented in styled "callout" boxes. Goal: Emphasize. Justification: Draws attention to crucial insights. The implementation section uses an accordion. Goal: Organize Text. Justification: Manages large blocks of text effectively. All visuals are created with HTML/CSS/Unicode to adhere to the NO SVG/Mermaid constraint. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
